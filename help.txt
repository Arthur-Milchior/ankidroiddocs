== AnkiDroid Questions
For questions and help concerning AnkiDroid, please visit the https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/anki-android[user forum], or send your questions to the forum's mailto:public-forum@ankidroid.org[public email address].

== Bug Reports and Feature Requests
For bug reports and feature requests, please search through the current list of open issues on the https://code.google.com/p/ankidroid/issues/list[AnkiDroid issue tracker], and if there are no existing issues, create a new issue including as much information as possible, including an error log whenever possible.

There are two ways to submit an error log: 

 *  After reproducing a crash, submit a crash report from within AnkiDroid, then go to http://ankidroid-triage.appspot.com/report_crashes/report_crashes[AnkiDroid Triage], set the version filter to the correct version you are using, then find the report that you just submitted and post a link to it in your bug report.

 * For all other errors where it's _not possible_ to submit a crash report from within AnkiDroid, please use an app such as https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nolanlawson.logcat[catlog] to capture the error log, and attach it in your bug report. Note that for Android 4.0+ root access is required to use these logging applications.
